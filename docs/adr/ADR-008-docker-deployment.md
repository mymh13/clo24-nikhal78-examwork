# ADR-008 – Deployment Strategy: Docker Containers via GHCR

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The project initially attempted to deploy the Blazor Server application to Azure App Service using **zip-deploy** with Oryx build system. The deployment process involved:
- Building the application in CI workflow
- Publishing as a framework-dependent .NET 8 application
- Deploying via zip to App Service
- Relying on Oryx auto-detection to identify and run the .NET application

**Critical Problem Encountered:**  
Despite explicit configuration in Bicep (`linuxFxVersion: 'DOTNET|8.0'`, `appCommandLine: 'dotnet Ticketing.Web.dll'`), Oryx consistently auto-detected PHP as the runtime, even when:
- `wwwroot` contained .NET DLL files
- App settings explicitly set `WEBSITE_STACK='DOTNET'`
- `SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT='false'` was configured
- `oryx-manifest.toml` was manually created

Oryx's auto-detection runs when the container starts, and if `wwwroot` is empty or doesn't match Oryx's expectations, it defaults to PHP. This behavior persisted across multiple attempts, including:
- Recreating the App Service
- Stopping/starting the service
- Clearing `wwwroot` and redeploying
- Adding explicit manifest files

The root cause appears to be Oryx's detection logic running before files are fully deployed, or cached container image choices that override explicit configuration.

## Decision

We switch to **Docker container deployment via GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** for the Blazor Server application. This approach:
- **Bypasses Oryx entirely** – Docker containers have the runtime pre-installed
- **Provides full control** over the runtime environment
- **Ensures reproducibility** – same image = same behavior
- **Eliminates auto-detection issues** – no ambiguity about runtime stack

The deployment process now:
1. Builds a Docker image in CI workflow (multi-stage build with .NET 8 SDK and runtime)
2. Pushes image to GHCR with tags: `web:latest` and `web:<git-sha>`
3. Updates App Service to use the Docker container image
4. App Service pulls and runs the container directly

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Dockerfile uses multi-stage build (SDK for build, ASP.NET runtime for final image)
- CI workflow builds and pushes to GHCR using GitHub Actions
- CD workflow updates App Service `linuxFxVersion` to point to the container image
- No authentication needed for public GHCR images (repo is public)
- Container includes only compiled application code (no secrets or sensitive data)

---

## Consequences

**Advantages:**  
- **Reliable runtime detection** – Docker container explicitly defines .NET 8 runtime
- **No Oryx interference** – complete bypass of auto-detection logic
- **Reproducible deployments** – same image behaves identically across environments
- **Faster troubleshooting** – container logs show actual .NET startup, not Oryx detection
- **Production-ready approach** – containers are industry standard for cloud deployments
- **No additional costs** – GHCR is free for public images
- **Simpler configuration** – no need for complex Oryx manifest files or app settings

**Disadvantages:**  
- **Longer CI time** – Docker build adds ~2-3 minutes to CI workflow (acceptable trade-off)
- **Requires Docker knowledge** – team needs basic Docker understanding (minimal requirement)
- **Image size** – Docker images are larger than zip deployments (acceptable for reliability)
- **If private images:** Would require GitHub Personal Access Token (not needed for public repo)

---

## Risks / Mitigations

- **Risk:** Docker build failures could block deployments.  
  **Mitigation:** Dockerfile is simple and follows Microsoft's official .NET 8 patterns. Build errors are clear and easy to debug.

- **Risk:** GHCR rate limits for public images.  
  **Mitigation:** GitHub provides generous limits for public images. For this project's scale, limits are not a concern.

- **Risk:** Container image contains sensitive data.  
  **Mitigation:** Dockerfile only copies compiled code. No secrets, connection strings, or appsettings files are included. `.gitignore` ensures sensitive files are excluded.

- **Risk:** Team unfamiliarity with Docker.  
  **Mitigation:** Dockerfile is minimal and well-documented. Standard .NET 8 patterns are used, making it easy to understand and maintain.

---

## Alternatives

- **Continue with Oryx/zip-deploy:** Attempted extensively but failed due to persistent PHP detection. Multiple workarounds (manifest files, app settings, container restarts) were unsuccessful. Rejected due to unreliability.

- **Azure Container Apps:** Alternative Azure service designed for containers. Rejected because App Service is already provisioned and meets requirements. Migration would add unnecessary complexity.

- **Azure Container Instances (ACI):** Lower-level container service. Rejected – App Service provides better integration with existing infrastructure (custom domains, SSL, scaling).

- **Self-hosted container registry:** Using Azure Container Registry (ACR) instead of GHCR. Rejected – GHCR is free, integrated with GitHub, and sufficient for project needs. ACR would add cost and complexity.

- **Keep trying Oryx fixes:** Multiple attempts over several days with various configurations. Rejected – time investment exceeded value. Docker solution works immediately and is more reliable long-term.

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Architecture Overview

```
CI Workflow:
  └─ Build Docker image (multi-stage)
  └─ Push to GHCR (ghcr.io/owner/repo/web:latest + :sha)

CD Workflow:
  └─ Get container image tag from CI
  └─ Update App Service linuxFxVersion
  └─ Restart App Service
```

### Dockerfile Structure

Located at: `src/web/Ticketing.Web/Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8080

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["src/web/Ticketing.Web/Ticketing.Web.csproj", "src/web/Ticketing.Web/"]
COPY ["src/shared/Ticketing.Contracts/Ticketing.Contracts.csproj", "src/shared/Ticketing.Contracts/"]
RUN dotnet restore "src/web/Ticketing.Web/Ticketing.Web.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/src/web/Ticketing.Web"
RUN dotnet build "Ticketing.Web.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "Ticketing.Web.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Ticketing.Web.dll"]
```

**Key Points:**
- Multi-stage build minimizes final image size
- Uses official Microsoft .NET 8 images
- Only compiled application code in final image
- No secrets or configuration files included

### CI Workflow Changes

**Removed:**
- `.NET build/publish` steps (Docker handles this)
- Artifact upload/download (not needed)
- Oryx manifest file creation
- Version file creation

**Added:**
- Docker login to GHCR
- Docker build and push with version tags

**Workflow Time:** ~43 seconds (acceptable for reliability)

### CD Workflow Changes

**Removed:**
- Artifact download
- Zip deployment
- Oryx configuration steps
- App settings for Oryx

**Added:**
- Container image tag extraction from CI workflow
- App Service `linuxFxVersion` update to Docker image
- App Service restart

**Workflow Time:** ~44 seconds (fast and reliable)

### Bicep Configuration

**App Service Configuration:**
```bicep
siteConfig: {
  linuxFxVersion: 'DOCKER|ghcr.io/mymh13/clo24-nikhal78-examwork/web:latest'
  appSettings: [
    {
      name: 'WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE'
      value: 'false'
    }
    {
      name: 'DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_URL'
      value: 'https://ghcr.io'
    }
    {
      name: 'DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_USERNAME'
      value: 'mymh13'
    }
    {
      name: 'DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_PASSWORD'
      value: ''  // Not needed for public images
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** For public GHCR images, no password is required. If images were private, a GitHub Personal Access Token would be needed.

### Verification

After deployment, verify the container is running correctly:

1. **Check App Service logs:**
   ```bash
   az webapp log tail --name examwork-web-dev --resource-group rg-examwork-dev
   ```
   Should show .NET startup messages, not PHP.

2. **Verify container image:**
   ```bash
   az webapp config show --name examwork-web-dev --resource-group rg-examwork-dev --query linuxFxVersion
   ```
   Should show: `DOCKER|ghcr.io/...`

3. **Check application:**
   Visit `https://ticket.mymh.dev` and verify the Blazor application loads correctly.

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: Container fails to start**
- Check Dockerfile syntax
- Verify .NET 8 runtime is correct
- Check App Service logs for container errors

**Issue: Image not found**
- Verify image exists in GHCR: https://github.com/owner/repo/packages
- Check image tag matches what's configured in App Service
- Ensure image is public (or token is configured if private)

**Issue: Slow deployments**
- Docker build time is ~2-3 minutes (acceptable trade-off)
- Consider Docker layer caching if needed (removed for simplicity)

## Lessons Learned

**Oryx Auto-Detection Issues:**
- Oryx's auto-detection can override explicit configuration
- Empty `wwwroot` at container startup triggers default PHP selection
- Container image choice may be cached, preventing runtime changes
- Multiple configuration attempts (app settings, manifests, restarts) were unsuccessful

**Docker Solution Benefits:**
- Immediate resolution of runtime detection issues
- Clear, predictable behavior
- Industry-standard approach for cloud deployments
- Better alignment with modern DevOps practices

**Key Takeaway:**  
When platform auto-detection fails despite explicit configuration, switching to explicit container definitions provides reliability and control that outweighs the slight increase in build complexity.
